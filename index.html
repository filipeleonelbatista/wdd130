                Hello! ðŸ‘‹  <br />
                <br />
                I'm a Front-end Developer with solid experience in React, React Native, Node JS and Typescript. With
                over 6 years of experience in web development, I have expertise in creating modern and efficient
                applications.<br />
                <br />
                I have a beautiful family that thanks to my wife and I we were able to guide on the path of the Lord. We
                have twins, David and John, and John has autism and is a challenge, but a blessing straight from the
                presence of God with an inexplicable purity.<br />
                <br />
                When I have the blessing of free time I like to play games like Call of Duty, or spend time with my kids
                at the park. Occasionally a special day with my wife.<br />
                <br />
                I already studied Computer Science at a university in Brazil, but due to financial problems I stopped in
                the 6th semester of 8 total semesters.<br />
                <br />
                I am very happy to be able to participate with you here and to be able to collaborate even a little bit
                with you.<br />
                <br />
                May God bless you all
            </p>
